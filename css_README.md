## Flexbox & Media Queries

Flexbox can be a tricky thing to wrap your head around. To practice what you have learned here today, it is best to give it a go yourself. Below are a couple of exercises that explore CSS flexbox and media queries—the beginnings of responsive design. Below we have provided a selection of games, tasks, and resources to look through which show you just how powerful these CSS tools are.

## MVP

- Have a go at the Flexbox Froggy exercises
- Have a go at CSS Grid Garden Game
- Add display: flex to the webpage you previously created
- Make use of display: grid in at least one place on your webpage

## Extensions:

- Introduce at least one media query to introduce an explicit responsive element

### Flexbox Froggy

If you fancy testing your knowledge but don't fancy building a webpage then Flexbox Froggy is a great online resource that we can recommend for testing your knowledge:

### Implicit Responsive Design

This exercise builds off of the _"Decomposition & Wireframing"_ exercises above. With your webpage from the previous example, repeat the same steps regarding decomposition and wireframing but for the desktop or mobile design—whichever you didn't build previously. Think about how you can arrange different parts of the page using `display: flex` and its adjoining properties.

Flexbox is as the name suggests: flexible. This flexibility is what you should introduce to your site initially when approaching responsive design. Because of the variation in screen widths, you must avoid pinning down your site as much as possible, as this would create avenues toward structural failure. Flexibility is key!

### Explicit Responsive Design

Sometimes, however, it isn't possible to do everything with flexbox. Hiding content, placing it behind togglable menus, or other large-scale organizational differences tied to screen size is best implemented with media queries. Play about with this feature to introduce the final bits to your responsive web page.

Dev Tools provides a means to visualize your page at the aspect ratios and apparent resolutions of different mobile devices. Simply click the little mobile phone icon at the top bar on either Chrome or Firefox.

Dev Tools can be opened in a separate window if you want to use it while also viewing your page fullscreen.
