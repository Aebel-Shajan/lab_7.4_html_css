# Decomposition, Wireframing & HTML

In this lab, you are required to find a website you like, create a simple Wireframe of it, and attempt to build it using HTML.

> Note: As we haven't fully jumped into CSS yet, you are not required to add any to this lab, this will be done in another lesson.

The first step is to take an existing webpage and break it down. Take a look at the page using the Dev Tools (`right click` + _`"inspect"`_ or `f12`) and try not to get too intimidated. A lot of modern web pages have many moving parts, some of which are not visually represented such as tracking scripts, so don't worry if you're not able to follow the entire DOM structure in front of you. At the top left of the Dev Tools is generally a square with an arrow in it. This is the **Inspect Tool** which allows you to click on an element on a webpage to move to it in the DOM. You may find this incredibly handy for this task.

## MVP

- Find a website that you like the look of that has interesting design elements
- Create a simple high-level wireframe for the website. You can use a tool like Figma, Miro or even draw it yourself. It does not need a lot of detail, but it should include the following:
  - Header
  - Navigation
  - Section
  - Footer
- Re-create this Wireframe using HTML and semantic elements. Make sure to include the semantic element for `header`, `nav`, `section`, and `footer`.

## Extensions

- Create a second page for your shiny new website
- Use the same Header, Navigation, and Footer from the first page
- Add a sign-up form to that web page that contains the following inputs:
  - Email
  - Profile Picture (File upload that only accepts `.png` file type)
  - Bio Textarea
  - Age (Number)
